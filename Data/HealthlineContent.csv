Emergency Kit for Home ,"Most injuries and illnesses are not life threatening. However, knowing how to treat minor injuries and illnesses can prevent them from becoming worse. Additionally, the ability to treat or stabilize more serious emergencies until medical help arrives may save a life. A well-stocked first aid kit for the home can prepare you for most unexpected situations. First aid kits can be purchased already stocked, or you can make your own. While supplies may differ from kit to kit, basic supplies that should be included in an emergency kit for the home include: Keep all the items together in a hard case or waterproof pack. Remember to check your first aid kit regularly to re-stock items that have been used and to remove and replace out-of-date supplies. non-latex gloves (at least two to three pairs) CPR one-way valve face shield antiseptic cleansing towelettes antibiotic ointment sterile dressings (4x4 gauze pads, roll gauze, and absorbent 5x9 compress dressings) adhesive bandages in a variety of sizes elastic bandage medical tape scissors tweezers triangular bandage with safety pins eye wash solution eye shield oral thermometer (non-glass) alcohol swabs to clean thermometer, tweezers, scissors non-prescription medications that the family may use, such as non-aspirin pain reliever and anti-diarrhea medication instant cold compress first aid instruction chart or book "
The Car Emergency Kit Everyone Should Have,"First aid is all about being prepared, whether at home, at work, or on the road. And although good car maintenance will help to prevent breakdowns, there's still the possibility that car trouble or bad weather may cause you to be stranded for a few hours, or even a few days. An emergency car kit, either purchased pre-packaged, or self-customized, will help to ensure your safety. The essential supplies to have in your car include: You can live for days, even weeks, without food. But you won't survive for very long without water. Look for emergency water pouches rather than bottled water; they'll take up less room. And check for water with a long shelf life. Look for high calorie energy bars with plenty of protein and carbohydrates, with a long shelf life and the ability to withstand hot and cold temperatures. Avoid salty foods that will increase your thirst and diminish your water supply too rapidly. Store food supplies in a hard plastic container. A rain jacket is good year round; add seasonal clothing such as hat, scarf, and gloves as appropriate. One or two wool blankets will provide warmth if you need to spend the night in your car. A space blanket or bag is best for cold weather conditions. These are made of reflective material that will absorb as much as 80 percent of your radiant body heat and keep you warm even in the winter. Two durable flashlights with extra batteries will light the way if you need to go for help, illuminate your view under the hood of the car, and also serve as hazard lights. Look for high power LED flashlights with a long run time. Of course, you're going to have jumper cables and equipment for changing a flat tire. But it's good to include a basic tool kit, a knife, and a collapsible shovel for shoveling your way out of the snow or mud. You won't always be in a location where there's a signal. But if you are, you can summon help. You may also want to invest in a wind up cell phone charger. If you take daily prescription medications, bring enough for several days. And if you use medical supplies such as a glucose meter, take it along. A basic first aid kit (see Emergency Kit for the Home) with a first aid instruction chart or book will help you to treat minor injuries and illnesses. Make sure to check and restock your emergency car kit at least once each season to make sure that you have everything you need. "
First Aid for Bites and Stings  ,"Not all bites or stings are the same. You will need different first aid treatment and medical care depending on what type of creature has bitten or stung you. Some species can cause more damage than others. Some people also have allergies that raise the risk of a serious reaction. Heres how to recognize and treat the symptoms of bites and stings from insects, spiders, and snakes. Insects Nearly everyone has been bitten or stung by an insect at one time or another. Whether youve been attacked by a mosquito, fly, bee, wasp, ant, or other bug, insect bites and stings usually cause a mild reaction. Your body reacts to venom or other proteins that insects inject into you or transfer to your body through their saliva. This can result in symptoms at the site of the bite or sting, such as: The severity of your symptoms can vary, depending on the type of insect that bites or stings you. Some people also develop a severe allergic reaction to insect stings or bites. Bee and wasp allergies are particularly common. A severe allergic reaction can cause: If you or someone you know begins to experience these symptoms shortly after being bitten or stung by an insect, call 911 or local emergency services. A severe allergic reaction that affects multiple parts of your body is called anaphylaxis. It can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. If youve ever had a severe reaction to an insect bite or sting, ask your doctor about allergy testing. If youve been diagnosed with a severe allergy, your doctor should prescribe a medication called epinephrine. You can use a preloaded epinephrine auto-injector (e.g., EpiPen) to inject the medication in your outer thigh muscle. It acts quickly to raise your blood pressure, stimulate your heart, and reduce swelling of your airways. You should carry it with you at all times, especially when youre outdoors in areas where you might encounter insects. If someone shows signs of a severe allergic reaction, help them get emergency medical attention and follow the steps in the next section. If they show no signs of a severe reaction, treat the site of the bite or sting for minor symptoms: If you suspect someone may be having a severe allergic reaction: To avoid making matters worse, dont apply a tourniquet. You should also avoid giving them anything to eat or drink. Spiders Most spider bites are relatively harmless. Anywhere from several hours to a day after you get bitten, you may notice symptoms similar to those of an insect sting or bite. At the site of the bite, you may experience: Some types of spiders can cause more serious reactions, including black widow and brown recluse spiders. If you know what to look for, its easy to identify both of these species.  Fully grown black widow spiders are about 1/2-inch long. They have a black body with a red hourglass marking on the underside of their abdomen. Some black widow spiders also have red spots on the upper surface of their abdomen and crosswise red bars on the underside. Black widow spider venom causes problems with your nervous system. Within a few hours of being bitten, you may notice intense pain at the site of the bite. You may also experience other symptoms, such as chills, fever, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Fully grown brown recluse spiders are larger than black widow spiders. Theyre about 1 inch in length. They vary in color from yellowish tan to dark brown. They have a violin-shaped marking on the surface of their upper body, with the base of the violin facing toward their head and the neck of the violin pointing toward their rear.  Brown recluse spider bites cause damage to your skin. Within about eight hours of being bitten, you will experience redness and intense pain at the site of the bite. Over time, a blister will develop. When the blister breaks down, it will leave a deep ulcer in your skin, which can become infected. You also may develop symptoms such as fever, rash, and nausea.  If you suspect that someone has been bitten by a brown recluse or black widow spider, help them get medical treatment immediately and follow the steps in the section. Otherwise, treat their spider bite like you would most insect bites and stings:  If you suspect that someone has been bitten by a brown recluse or black widow spider: Dont apply a tourniquet.

Hot Weather Safety ,"After a long winter, many people look forward to spending time outdoors in the summer warmth. But excessive exposure to high temperatures and humidity, or performing strenuous activities during hot weather, may result in life-threatening heat-related illnesses. As with cold weather exposure, the elderly and young are most at risk. However, anyone can succumb to high heat exposure. Two common hot-weather health emergencies areheat strokeandheat exhaustion. Heat Stroke Heat stroke occurs when the body loses its ability to regulate its internal temperature. The sweating mechanism (the bodys way of cooling itself) shuts down, and the body temperature rapidly risesas high as 106F or more.Symptoms of heat stroke include: Heat stroke is a medical emergency. Medical help must be sought immediately, while efforts are taken to cool the person. These include moving him or her to a shady area and lowering the body temperature with cool (but not cold) water. This should be applied to the body with a sponge, wet towels, or sheets. Monitor the persons temperature until medical help arrives. If the person has nausea, is vomiting, or is unconscious, do not attempt to give fluids. Heat Exhaustion Heat exhaustion is a milder form of heat-related illness than heat stroke. It develops more slowly, and may occur after several days of heat exposure and inadequate fluid replacement. Symptoms of heat exhaustion include: If not treated, heat exhaustion can progress to heat stroke. If symptoms are severe or the person has a heart condition, medical attention should be summoned while cooling efforts begin. Cool the body as you would do for heat stroke, and offer cool, nonalcoholic beverages to drink. If symptoms persist longer than an hour, seek medical treatment. Safety Tips Heat-related illness is preventable. Heres what to do to stay safe in hot weather: high body temperature hot skin with absence of sweating headache dizziness nausea rapid pulse confusion loss of consciousness profuse sweating dizziness weakness headache nausea or vomiting fatigue muscle cramps Listen to weather reports for heat advisories.Stay indoors, ideally in air conditioning, as much as possible and during the afternoon when temperatures are at their highest. People older than 65 who are at high risk for heat-related illnesses should be especially mindful.. Dress for the weather in lightweight, light-colored, loose clothing.Cover as much skin as possible with proper clothing and a hat, or use an umbrella. Apply sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15, and continue to apply it according to label directions. Eat lighter meals;heavy meals can increase your core body temperature. Save strenuous outdoor activities for the cooler morning hours, if at all possible.  Dont wait until you feel thirsty to drink.Increase your fluid intake, even if youre inactive.If you are working or playing outdoors, you need to consume two to four glasses of water every hour. If you sweat, some of this fluid can come from sports beverages, which will help to replace salt and minerals lost through sweat.(Those who are on fluid or salt restrictions should consult a medical professional for advice about fluid replacement and sports drinks.) Learn the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. If you recognize early symptoms of heat-related illness in yourself or another person, move indoors or at least to a shady area, drink cool fluids, and rest. "
Travel First Aid - Tips for Packing the Right Supplies,"Most first aid skills are applicable in any emergency situation, whether at home, at work, or on the road. But there are special measures you should take when traveling.  For instance, because youll be away from your health-care provider, you should bring a record of important health information. This should include your health conditions, allergies, medications, doctors name and contact number, and insurance information.  Travelers also should check with a physician to ensure that their vaccinations are up to date. Ask about any special vaccinations or medications needed to travel to your destination.  It is also important to pack enough prescription medication. Bring extra in case your plans change unexpectedly. Be sure to stock up on pain relievers for muscle aches, sleep aids to combat jetlag, and medications for an upset stomach and diarrhea, as these are common travelers complaints. Make sure all medications are in their original bottles and labeled with the patients name, medication name, prescribing physician information, pharmacy contact number, and directions for use. Medications should be kept with the traveler, not checked with baggage. If you or anyone in your group has a chronic or life-threatening condition, invest in a medical identification bracelet. In the event of an emergency, it gives medical personnel important information about the condition. First Aid Kit Just as you prepare first aid kits for your home and car, you should also create one for travel. Your travel kit can be customized for every trip. You will want to bring basic supplies found in your standard home emergency kit, but you should also include other items. Consider the following: How many people are going on the trip?You need to bring enough supplies for the number of people traveling with you. How long will you be gone?Prescription and over-the-counter medications should be adequate to last for the duration of the trip, plus a few days extra in case of travel delays. Where are you going?For instance, on a wilderness trip, youll need special gear, including a compass, a water-filtering bottle or water purification tablets, and a whistle. An over-the-counter antihistamine should be included in case of allergic reactions. And a first aid instruction manual, preferably for wilderness travel, is desirable as you may be far from immediate medical help. What will you be doing?If you plan to hike, for example, youll want to include moleskin to protect your heels from blisters. If youre boating, motion sickness medication is a must. Insect repellant, sunscreen, calamine lotion, and aloe or another burn gel are essential for almost all outdoor adventures. "

First Aid for Seniors,"In many emergency situations, you dont need special knowledge beyond standard first-aid and CPR skills to care for people aged 65 and older. Still, its important to know that older adults are more vulnerable to accidents and injuries, which may require immediate first aid assistance. Understanding some of the common first aid medical situations that older adults face can help you prepare for possible emergencies. Some situations that may require first aid include:  Falls One in three adults aged 65 and older fall each year, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Falls can lead to: Common risk factors for falling include: If someone has fallen and they dont seem badly hurt, help them find a comfortable position.

If you notice signs of serious bleeding, bruising, or swelling, help them get emergency medical care. If you suspect someone has fallen and seriously hurt their head, neck, back, hips, or thighs, ask them not to move and call 911 or local emergency services. Reassure them and keep them warm until help arrives. If they stop breathing, perform CPR. Cuts and scrapes Your skin becomes more fragile with age. This raises the risk of cuts and scrapes in older adults. In some cases, these injuries become infected. While older age itself doesnt cause infections, many older adults have chronic health conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease. These conditions can lower their immune systems defenses against infections.  Remove obvious dirt and debris from the wound to treat Clean the wound with tap water if available. If its bleeding, place a clean bandage or cloth on top of it. Press on it firmly, or apply pressure by binding the area in tape. Raise the injured area above the persons heart level. If blood seeps through the first layer of bandage or cloth, dont remove it. Simply add a second layer on top.  If the person has a severe cut or heavy bleeding that wont stop, help them get emergency medical care. If they only have a minor cut or scrape, wait for the bleeding to stop and then wash the wound using soap and clean water. Encourage the person to keep the wound clean, watch for signs of infection such as: Make an appointment with their doctor if it becomes infected. Applying an antibiotic cream or ointment can help promote healing. Heat- and cold-related illness As you age, youre more likely to develop chronic medical conditions that impair your bodys temperature regulation. Older adults may also take prescription medications that change their temperature balance. Thats why its particularly important for older adults to use sunscreen and wear appropriate protective clothing when outdoors. They should dress in layers that protect them from warm or cold weather. Staying hydrated is also very important to help to protect them against heat-related illnesses. The symptoms of heatstroke include:  If you suspect someone is having a heatstroke, contact 911 or local emergency services. Then, move them out of the heat and cool them off. For example, help them get into a cool shower, sponge them with cool water, have them drink ice water or cover their body in cool damp sheets or towels. If they stop breathing, start CPR. The symptoms of mild hypothermia include: The symptoms of moderate to severe hypothermia include:  If you think someone has hypothermia, call 911 or local emergency services. Then, help them warm up. For example, bring them indoors out of cold weather, help them remove wet clothes, and cover them with warm dry blankets. Reheat them gradually and focus on warming their chest and abdomen before their limbs. If they stop breathing, start CPR. Cardiovascular Problems Age-related changes in heart and blood vessels put older adults at greater risk of heart attacks, heart failure, and strokes. According to the American Stroke Association, the symptoms of a stroke include drooping of the face, weakness of the arms, and difficulty speaking The symptoms of a heart attack include chest pain, shortness of breath, and discomfort in your upper body.

First Aid for Anaphylaxis & Allergy Attacks ,"Many people have experienced symptoms of an allergy, such as a runny nose, sneezing, itchy eyes or skin, rashes, and asthma. An allergy is when your immune system is over reactive to a specific substance (allergen). These can include pollen, dust mites, mold, pets, insects, foods, or medications.  When you come into contact with an allergen, your body assumes it is a foreign invader and the immune systems releases substances to fight off the invader. These substances result in other cells releasing chemicals, which cause an allergic reaction.  While most allergies are not serious and can be controlled with standard medication, some allergy attacks can be life threatening.  Anaphylaxis is a severe, whole body reaction. A severe allergy attack may be initiated by food, such as milk, wheat, eggs, or nuts. It can also be related to insect stings such as from wasps or bees, or some medication. Symptoms Symptoms of anaphylaxis include: Many people who are aware of their severe allergies carry a medication called epinephrine. This is injected into the muscle through an auto injector and is easy to use.It acts quickly on the body to raise your blood pressure, stimulate your heart, decrease swelling, and improve breathing. First Aid If you are experiencing anaphylaxis, or encounter someone who is, take these immediate steps. It is important to get medical treatment for an allergy attack, even if the person begins to recover. Many times symptoms can improve, but then worsen quickly after a period of time. Medical care is necessary to prevent recurrence of the attack. abdominal cramps heart palpitations nausea and vomiting swelling of the face, lips, or throat skin reactions like hives, itching, paleness, or peeling  breathing problems dizziness and/or fainting shock weak and rapid pulse Ask someone to call for medical help, or call 911 if you are alone. Ask the person whether he or she carries an epinephrine injector, and if so, assist him or her according to label directions. Help the person to remain calm and lie quietly, with legs elevated. If vomiting occurs turn him or her onto the side to prevent choking. Do not give them anything to drink. If the person becomes unconscious and stops breathing, begin CPR, and continue until medical help arrives. "
First Aid: CPR ,"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, is a lifesaving technique. It aims to keep blood and oxygen flowing through the body when a persons heartbeat and breathing have stopped. It can be performed by any trained person. It involves external chest compressions and rescue breathing.  CPR performed within the first six minutes of the heart stopping can keep someone alive until medical help arrives. Although rescue breathing techniques were used to revive drowning victims as early as the 18th century, it wasnt until 1960 that external cardiac massage was proven to be an effective revival technique. The American Heart Association then developed a formal CPR program. While there is no substitute for formal CPR training taught by certified instructors, the American Heart Association has recently recommended that persons who have not received CPR training initiate hands only CPR (without rescue breathing). This method is easy to perform, is proven to save lives, and is better than waiting until trained help arrives.  Hands-Only Steps Make sure its safe for you to reach the victim. Check the Person for Responsiveness Shake the shoulder and ask loudly, Are you OK? For an infant, tap the bottom of the foot and check for a reaction. Or ask someone else to call. If youre alone and believe the person is a victim of drowning, or if the victim is a child, begin CPR first, perform for two minutes, and then call 911. If an automated external defibrillator (AED) is readily available, use this device to check the victims heart rhythm andif the machine instructsdeliver one electric shock to the victims heart before beginning chest compressions. If the victim is a child ages 1 to 8, perform CPR first for two minutes before checking the heart with an AED. Also, use the devices pediatric pads if they are available. An AEDs usefulness in infants under one year of age is not conclusive or strongly recommended.  If an AED is not immediately available, do not waste precious seconds or moments looking for the device. Start chest compressions immediately.  For adults, place the heel of one hand in the center of the persons chest, between the nipples. Put the other hand on top of the first hand and interlock your fingers so they are drawn up and the heel of the hand remains on the chest. For children ages one to eight, use just one hand in the center of the chest, between the nipples. For infants, place two fingers in the center of the chest, slightly below the nipple line. For an adult, use your upper body to push straight down on the chest at least 2 inches, and at a rate of 100 compressions per minute. Allow the chest to recoil between compressions. For ages 1 to 8, push straight down on the chest about 2 inches at a rate of 100 compressions per minute, and allow the chest to recoil between compressions. For an infant, push straight down on the chest 1&frac12; inches at a rate of 100 compressions per minute, and again let the chest recoil between compressions. Repeat the compression cycle until the victim starts to breathe, or medical help arrives. If the person begins to breathe, have them lie on their side quietly until medical help arrives. Steps for Mouth-to-Mouth In 2010, the American Heart Association revised its CPR guidelines, announcing that chest compressions should be performed first, before opening the victims airway. The new acronym C-A-B (Compressions-Airway-Breathing) now replaces the old A-B-C (Airway-Breathing-Compressions) model. In the first few minutes of cardiac arrest, there is still oxygen in the victims lungs and bloodstream. Therefore, starting chest compressions first (on an individual who is unresponsive or not breathing normally) can help send this critical oxygen to the brain and heart without any delay.  If youre trained in CPR and come across an individual who is unresponsive or having difficulty breathing, follow the steps for Hands-Only CPR for 30 chest compressions. Then perform the following actions: Put the palm of your hand on the persons forehead, and tilt the head back. Gently lift the chin forward with the other hand. For small children and infants, a head tilt alone will often open the airway. This is appropriate for ages one through adulthood. With the airway open, pinch the nostrils shut, and cover the persons mouth with a CPR face mask to make a seal. For infants, cover both mouth and nose with the mask. If a mask is not available, cover the persons mouth with yours. Then give two rescue breaths, each lasting about one second. Watch for the chest to rise with each breath. If it does not rise, reposition the face mask and try again. Continue CPR, alternating 30 compressions with two rescue breaths, until the person begins to breathe or until medical help arrives. If the person begins to breathe, have him or her lie on their side quietly until medical assistance is on the scene.. Training The American Red Cross and the American Heart Association (AHA), as well as other agencies, offer CPR training as well as training in the use of an automated external defibrillator (AED).  The AED is a device that can detect abnormalities in a patients heart rhythm and, if needed, deliver an electric shock to the chest (defibrillation) to restore normal rhythm to the heart. According to the AHA, most sudden cardiac arrests are caused by a fast and irregular heart rhythm that begins in the hearts lower chambers, or ventricles. This is called ventricular fibrillation. An AED can help restore the hearts normal rhythm and even help revive a person whose heart has stopped functioning.  With training, an AED is easy to use. In conjunction with CPR, the device (when used properly) greatly increases a victims chances for survival. "
Heimlich Maneuver ,"Each year, many people die from choking on objects that obstruct their airways and cause suffocation. Choking is in fact the fourth leading cause of unintentional death. However, there is a simple technique you can use to help expel a trapped object from another persons airway. You can even use a version of this technique on yourself. The technique is called the Heimlich maneuver, or abdominal thrusts. Abdominal thrusts lift your diaphragm and expel air from your lungs. This causes the foreign object to be expelled from your airway. The Red Cross also recommends including five back blows, although some institutes, such as the American Heart Association, dont teach this technique. Steps The steps you need to perform a Heimlich maneuver depend on who youre aiding: Regardless of whom you perform the maneuver on, that person should still get medical help afterward. This is to ensure no physical damage has occurred to their throat and airways. Determine whether you need to perform abdominal thrusts. If a person who appears to be choking is conscious and coughing, they may be able to dislodge the object on their own. Administer first aid if the person is: First, if theres a bystander, have them call 911 (or your local emergency phone number) for emergency help. If youre the only person present, begin first aid treatment: Alternatively, if the person cant stand up, straddle their waist, facing their head. Push your fist inward and upward in the same manner as you would if they were standing. On pregnant women, you need to place your hand a little higher on their torso, around the base of their breastbone. If that person is unconscious, place them on their back and try to clear the airway with your finger in a sweeping motion. If you cant remove the lodged object, begin performing CPR. If the person who is choking is younger than 1 year, you need to follow other steps: If youre alone and choking, follow these steps: You can also thrust your upper abdomen against a hard edge like the corner of a table or counter, or back of a chair. Videos You may find these Heimlich maneuver training videos helpful to watch: 
        Choking is the fourth leading cause of unintentional death. Performing the Heimlich maneuver can help save a person from choking. 
        The steps for the Heimlich maneuver differ if the person youre helping is conscious or unconscious. They also differ for pregnant women and infants. 
        You can perform this maneuver on yourself. another person who isnt pregnant or an infant (under a year old) a pregnant woman or an infant yourself not coughing unable to speak or breathe signaling for help, typically by holding their hands around their throat Get the person to stand up. Position yourself behind the person. Lean the person forward and give five blows to their back with the heel of your hand. Place your arms around their waist. Make a fist and place it just above the navel, thumb side in. Grab the fist with your other hand and push it inward and upward at the same time. Perform five of these abdominal thrusts. Repeat until the object is expelled and the person can breathe or cough on their own. Sit down and hold the infant facedown on your forearm, which should be resting on your thigh. Give five back blows gently with the heel of your hand. If that doesnt work, position the infant face up and resting on your forearm and thigh so their head is lower than their trunk. Place two fingers at the center of their breastbone and perform five quick chest compressions. Repeat the back blows and chest thrusts until the object is expelled and the infant can breathe or cough on their own. Make a fist and place it just above your navel, thumb side in. Grab the fist with your other hand and push it inward and upward at the same time. Perform five of these abdominal thrusts. Repeat until the object is expelled and you can breathe or cough on your own. "
How to Stop Bleeding,"Injuries and certain medical conditions can result in bleeding. This can trigger anxiety and fear, but bleeding has a healing purpose. Still, you need to understand how to treat common bleeding incidents such as cuts and bloody noses, as well as when to seek medical help. Bleeding emergencies Before you begin to treat an injury, you should identify its severity as best you can. There are some situations in which you shouldnt try to administer any kind of first aid at all. If you suspect that theres internal bleeding or if theres an embedded object surrounding the site of the injury, immediately call 911 or your local emergency services. Also seek immediate medical care for a cut or wound if: If a person is bleeding profusely, be on the lookout for symptoms of shock. Cold, clammy skin, a weakened pulse, and loss of consciousness can all indicate that a person is about to go into shock from blood loss, according to the Mayo Clinic. Even in cases of moderate blood loss, the bleeding person may feel lightheaded or nauseous. If possible, have the injured person lie down on the floor while you wait for medical care to arrive. If they are able, have them elevate their legs above their heart. This should help circulation to the vital organs while you wait for help. Hold continuous direct pressure on the wound until help arrives.  Cuts and wounds When your skin is cut or scraped, you begin to bleed. This is because blood vessels in the area are damaged. Bleeding serves a useful purpose because it helps to clean out a wound. However, too much bleeding can cause your body to go into shock. You cant always judge the seriousness of a cut or wound by the amount it bleeds. Some serious injuries bleed very little. On the other hand, cuts on the head, face, and mouth may bleed a lot because those areas contain a lot of blood vessels. Abdominal and chest wounds can be quite serious because internal organs may be damaged, which can cause internal bleeding as well as shock. Abdominal and chest wounds are considered an emergency, and you should call for immediate medical help. This is especially important if there are symptoms of shock, which may include: A first aid kit thats properly stocked can make all the difference in stopping heavy bleeding. You should keep the following items around for situations where you may need to close a wound:  Saline wash can also be helpful to have on hand in order to clear out debris or dirt from a wound without touching it. An antiseptic spray, applied at the site of the cut, can help staunch blood flow and also reduce the risk of a cut becoming infected later on.  In the days following an injury, be on the lookout to ensure that a wound is healing correctly. If the initial scab covering the wound grows bigger or becomes surrounded by redness, there may be an infection. A cloudy fluid or pus draining from the wound is also a sign of possible infection. If the person develops a fever or begins to have pain again at the sign of the cut, seek medical attention immediately.  Minor injuries Sometimes injuries that arent traumatic or painful can bleed a great deal. Nicks from shaving, scrapes from falling off of a bike, and even pricking a finger with a sewing needle can result in excessive bleeding. For minor injuries such as these, youll still want to stop the injury from bleeding. A sterilized bandage or Band-Aid, antiseptic spray, and a healing agent such as Neosporin can all be helpful in treating these injuries and preventing future infection.  Even with a minor cut, its possible to have nicked an artery or blood vessel. If bleeding is still occurring after 20 minutes, medical attention is needed. Dont ignore a wound that wont stop bleeding just because it looks small or isnt painful.  Bloody nose A bloody nose is common in both children and adults. Most nosebleeds are not serious, especially in children. Yet, adults can have nosebleeds related to high blood pressure or hardening of the arteries, and it may be more difficult to stop them. Having tissues in your first aid kit, along with a topical nasal spray that is designed to go in the nasal passage (such as Sinex or Afrin), will help you administer first aid for a nosebleed. Seek professional help for a nosebleed if bleeding does not stop after about 20 minutes, or if the nosebleed is related to a fall or injury. The nose may have been broken during an injury. Recurring nosebleeds could be a symptom of something more serious, so tell a doctor if youre having regular nosebleeds.  Takeaway Any situation that involves heavy bleeding can create fear and stress. Most people dont want to see their own blood, let alone someone elses! But staying calm and being prepared with a well-established first aid kit can make a difficult and painful experience a lot less traumatic. Remember that emergency help is only a phone call away, and take any incident of heavy bleeding seriously. its jagged, deep, or a puncture wound its on the face its the result of an animal bite theres dirt that wont come out after washing the bleeding will not stop after 15 to 20 minutes of first aid dizziness weakness pale and clammy skin shortness of breath increased heart rate sterilized medical gloves sterile gauze dressings small scissors medical grade tape Help the person to remain calm. If the cut is large or bleeding heavily, have them lie down. If the wound is on an arm or leg, raise the limb above the heart to slow bleeding. Remove obvious debris from the wound, such as sticks or grass.   If the cut is small, wash it out with soap and water.  After putting on clean latex gloves, apply firm pressure to the wound with a folded cloth or bandage for about 10 minutes. If blood soaks through, add another cloth or bandage and continue putting pressure on the cut for an additional 10 minutes. When bleeding has stopped, tape a clean bandage over the cut. Dont remove an object if its embedded in the body. Dont attempt to clean a large wound. When first applying the bandage, dont remove it to look at the wound during this time. It may begin bleeding again. Have the person sit down and lean their head forward. This will reduce pressure in the nasal veins and slow the bleeding. It will also keep blood from flowing down into the stomach, which can cause nausea. If youd like, use a nasal spray in the bleeding nostril while the person holds their head still. Have them push the bleeding nostril firmly against the septum (the dividing wall in the nose). If the person is unable to do this, put on latex gloves and hold the nose for them for five to 10 minutes. Once the nose stops bleeding, instruct the person not to blow their nose for several days. This could dislodge the clot and cause bleeding to begin again.  "
Wrapping & First Aid for Strains & Sprains ,"Strains and sprains are injuries to the soft tissues of the body. Strains involve muscles or tendons (thick bands that attach muscles to bone). Strains often occur in the back, the hamstring, or the groin. Sprains are injuries to the ligaments, which are bands of cartilage that attach bone to bone. Sprains often occur in the ankles, knees, or wrists. Symptoms of a strain or sprain include pain, swelling and bruising in the injured area. In general, the more severe the injury, the more severe the symptoms will be. First aid care for sprains and sprains includes four steps. They are commonly referred to as RICE: R: Rest the affected body part. Use a splint, sling, or crutches, if possible. I: Ice the injured body part. Use a cold compress, a bag of frozen vegetables, or a baggie of ice cubes wrapped in a washcloth. Dont put ice directly on the skin, as you can cause injury to the skin. Keep the ice on the area for about 20 minutes, three or four times a day for the first 48 hours. C: Compress the injury (if possible) to decrease swelling. Use an elastic wrap to encircle the injured area, starting at the lower part of the injury and working upward toward the heart. As you wind the wrap around the injury, overlap it with each circle by half the width of the wrap. The wrap should be snug but not tight; if the persons extremity is numb or tingling, or if the toes or fingers on the wrapped body part are cold or blue, the wrap is too tight. Loosen the wrap and begin again, wrapping more loosely. E: Elevate the injured body part above the level of the heart. Seek medical help immediately if the person is unable to bear weight at all or if pain is severe. "
First Aid for Broken Bones and Fractures,"A broken bone happens when one of your bones becomes cracked or broken into multiple pieces. Its also known as a fracture. It can result from a sports injury, accident, or violent trauma.  Broken bones usually arent life threatening, but they do require immediate medical care. Learn how to recognize the symptoms of a broken bone, provide first-aid treatment, and get professional help. Symptoms A broken bone can cause one or more of the following signs and symptoms: First aid If you suspect that someone has a broken bone, provide first-aid treatment and help them get professional care:  If the person doesnt appear to be breathing, is unconscious, or both, call 911 for medical help and begin CPR. You should also call 911 if: Otherwise, help them get to the emergency department by car or other means so a doctor can diagnose their condition and recommend appropriate treatment. intense pain in the injured area that gets worse when you move it numbness in the injured area bluish color, swelling, or visible deformity in the injured area bone protruding through the skin heavy bleeding at the injury site Stop any bleeding: If theyre bleeding, elevate and apply pressure to the wound using a sterile bandage, a clean cloth, or a clean piece of clothing. Immobilize the injured area: If you suspect theyve broken a bone in their neck or back, help them stay as still as possible. If you suspect theyve broken a bone in one of their limbs, immobilize the area using a splint or sling.  Apply cold to the area: Wrap an ice pack or bag of ice cubes in a piece of cloth and apply it to the injured area for up to 10 minutes at a time.  Treat them for shock: Help them get into a comfortable position, encourage them to rest, and reassure them. Cover them with a blanket or clothing to keep them warm. Get professional help: Call 911 or help them get to the emergency department for professional care. you suspect theyve broken a bone in their head, neck, or back the fractured bone has pushed through their skin theyre bleeding heavily "
First Aid for Eye Injuries ,"Any kind of injury or trauma to the eyes should be taken seriously. Prompt medical attention for eye problems can save your vision and prevent further complications.  Chemical burns Chemicals common at home or in the workplace can easily get splashed into your eyes. It is important to wear safety glasses when handling toxic or abrasive chemicals and use caution with household cleaners in order to prevent injury. First aid care for chemical burns includes: You can also call your local poison control center for instructions. Be prepared to give information about the name and type of chemical, if possible. Foreign object The eye often cleans itself of debris with tearing, so no treatment is needed until you are certain the eye cannot remove the object by itself.  First aid care for foreign objects in the eyes includes: If there is an object embedded in the eye, do NOT remove it, as this may cause further damage. Instead, cover the eye with an eye shield or gauze and seek prompt medical attention. Blows to the eye Impact to the eye is another form of eye trauma. Minor blows can often be managed at home. Any eye injury should be monitored for signs of a serious injury or potential infection.  First aid care for a blow to the eyes includes: Seek immediate medical attention if you notice any of the following symptoms: Cuts and wounds You should seek immediate medical care if you suffer this type of injury. However, you need to follow some basic first aid steps to ensure proper safety and support. Here are some first aid tips for treating cuts and puncture wounds: 
        Any kind of injury or trauma to the eyes should be taken seriously. 
        Prompt medical attention for eye problems can save your vision and prevent further complications. 
        Learn about the different types of first aid that you should administer for varied eye injuries. Remain calm and keep your eyes open until they can be flushed. Closing your eyes traps the chemical in and does further damage. Flush eyes generously with water for 15 to 20 minutes. Make sure you keep your eyes open during flushing. Get immediate medical care. Dont rub your eyes. Lift the upper eyelid up and out over the lower lid, and then roll your eyes around. Flush your eyes generously with water, and keep your eyes open during flushing. Repeat the previous steps until the object is eliminated. Follow up with a doctor to make sure all debris is gone and the eyes have not been scratched or damaged. Your doctor may evaluate you for damage by using a special eye drop that fluoresces under a certain type of light; it will help reveal any cuts or scratches in the cornea. Gently place a cold compress over your eye in 5- to 10-minute intervals. Do not place ice directly on the skin. Instead, use a cloth in between the ice and skin. Call your doctor. They may want to examine the eye for potential damage. If the trauma was significant (for example, skull fracture or displaced bones), you will need to go to an emergency department for immediate evaluation. After 24 hours, switch to warm compresses. This will help lessen bruising. drainage from the affected eye vision changes persistent pain  any visible abnormalities or bleeding in the sclera, which is the white part of the eye Do not wash the eye or lid. If there is an object embedded in your eye, do NOT remove it. Doing so can cause further damage. Cover the eye with an eye shield. If you dont have one available, place the bottom half of a paper cup over your eye and tape over it gently to secure it to your face. Seek prompt medical attention. "
