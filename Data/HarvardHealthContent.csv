Emergencies and First Aid - Direct Pressure to Stop Bleeding - Harvard Health,"A wound that is deep, bleeding heavily, or has blood spurting from it (caused by bleeding from an artery), may not clot and may not stop bleeding. Immediate careCall out for someone to get help, or call 911 yourself. Elevate the wound and apply direct pressure. If severe bleeding does not stop with direct pressure and elevation, apply direct pressure to an artery. Use direct pressure on an artery along with elevation and direct pressure on the wound. There are specific major arteries in the body where pressure should be placed (see illustration below). When you apply pressure to an artery, you stop bleeding by pushing the artery against bone. Press down firmly on the artery between the bleeding site and the heart. If there is severe bleeding, also apply firm pressure directly to the bleeding site. To check if bleeding has stopped, release your fingers slowly from the pressure point, but do not release pressure at the bleeding site. If bleeding continues, continue to apply pressure to the artery. Continue until the bleeding stops or until help arrives. After bleeding stops, do not continue to apply pressureto an artery for longer than 5 minutes. "
Emergencies and First Aid - Bleeding - Harvard Health,"While a minor cut will eventually stop bleeding, a severe injury may require elevation and direct pressure on the wound. The goals of first-aid treatment are to control bleeding and prevent infection. If disposable surgical gloves are readily available, use them. Butterfly Bandages How to Stop a Nosebleed "
Emergencies and First Aid - Choking - Harvard Health,"A person who is choking will instinctively grab at the throat. The person also may panic, gasp for breath, turn blue, or be unconscious. If the person can cough or speak, he or she is getting air. Nothing should be done. Immediate careIf the person cannot cough or speak, begin the Heimlich maneuver immediately to dislodge the object blocking the windpipe. The Heimlich maneuver creates an artificial cough by forcing the diaphragm up toward the lungs. If you are choking and alone, you can perform the Heimlich maneuver on yourself by giving yourself abdominal thrusts. Or position yourself over the back of a chair or against a railing or counter and press forcefully enough into it so that the thrust dislodges the object.   "
Emergencies and First Aid - Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation - Harvard Health,"When you are alone and have to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), your primary effort should be compressing the chest to help the person's heart pump blood. If there is a second person helping, providing breaths can be done at the same time as compressions are performed. The brief review of CPR on the following pages can help you in an emergency; however, this information should not take the place of a certified course in CPR. Immediate care Assess the situation. Call out for someone to get help or call 911 yourself if the person does not seem to need immediate assistance. You can determine this by gently shaking the person and asking in a loud voice, ""Are you OK?"" If there is no response, begin CPR and continue until help arrives. "
Emergencies and First Aid - Mouth-to-Mouth Resuscitation - Harvard Health,"Place the child on a hard, flat surface. Look into the mouth and throat to ensure that the airway is clear. If an object is present, try to sweep it out with your fingers. If unsuccessful and the object is blocking the airway, apply the Heimlich maneuver. If vomiting occurs, turn the child onto his or her side and sweep out the mouth with two fingers. Tilt the head back slightly to open the airway. Place your mouth tightly over the nose and mouth. Blow two quick, shallow breaths (smaller breaths than you would give to an adult). Watch for the chest to rise. Remove your mouth. Look for the chest to fall as the child exhales.  Listen for the sounds of breathing. Feel for the child's breath on your cheek. If breathing does not start on its own, repeat the procedure.  1. Make sure the person is lying on a hard, flat surface. Look into the mouth and throat to ensure that the airway is clear. If an object is present, try to sweep it out with your fingers (wear disposable surgical gloves if they are available). Apply the Heimlich maneuver if unsuccessful and the object is blocking the airway. If vomiting occurs, turn the person on his or her side and sweep out the mouth with two fingers. Do not place your finger in the mouth if the person is rigid or is having a seizure.  2. Tilt the head back slightly to open the airway. Put upward pressure on the jaw to pull it forward.  3. Pinch the nostrils closed with thumb and index finger. Place your mouth tightly over the person's mouth. Use a mouthpiece if one is available. Blow two quick breaths and watch for the person's chest to rise.  4. Release the nostrils. Look for the person's chest to fall as he or she exhales. Listen for the sounds of breathing. Feel for the person's breath on your cheek. If the person does not start breathing on his or her own, repeat the procedure. "
Emergencies and First Aid - Emergency Checklist - Harvard Health,This list describes your priorities in an emergency situation. Follow these steps: 
Emergencies and First Aid - Recovery Position - Harvard Health,"This position helps a semiconscious or unconscious person breathe and permits fluids to drain from the nose and throat so they are not breathed in. If the person is unconscious or semiconscious after you have done everything on the Emergency Checklist, move the person into the recovery position while waiting for help to arrive. Do not use the recovery position if the person has a major injury, such as a back or neck injury  1. Kneel next to the person. Place the arm closest to you straight out from the body. Position the far arm with the back of the hand against the near cheek.  2. Grab and bend the person's far knee.  3. Protecting the head with one hand, gently roll the person toward you by pulling the far knee over and to the ground.  4. Tilt the head up slightly so that the airway is open. Make sure that the hand is under the cheek. Place a blanket or coat over the person (unless he or she has a heat illness or fever) and stay close until help arrives. Place the infant face down over your arm with the head slightly lower than the body. Support the head and neck with your hand, keeping the mouth and nose clear. Wait for help to arrive.  "

Emergencies and First Aid - How to Make a Sling - Harvard Health,"1. To make a sling, cut a piece of cloth, such as a pillowcase, about 40 inches square. Then cut or fold the square diagonally to make a triangle. Slip one end of the bandage under the arm and over the shoulder. Bring the other end of the bandage over the other shoulder, cradling the arm.  2. Tie the ends of the bandage behind the neck. Fasten the edge of the bandage, near the elbow, with a safety pin.  Use a collar and cuff sling for a suspected fracture of the collarbone or elbow when a triangular sling is not available. Wrap a strip of sheet, a pants leg, or pantyhose around the wrist and tie the ends behind the neck. "

Emergencies and First Aid - Back Injuries - Harvard Health,"Unless the person is able to tell you to the contrary, assume that anyone with a back injury also has a neck injury.  Place a board, such as a door or table leaf, next to the person. The board should extend below the buttocks (ideally to the feet) and above the head. Keeping the head aligned with the rest of the body, gently logroll the person toward you. Move the board under the person and ease him or her onto it. If the person is vomiting, lay him or her on one side and continue to support the head.  Tie tightly enough so the person cannot move, but not so tightly that you cut off circulation or inhibit breathing. Place towels, sweaters, or pillows snugly around the person, especially alongside the head and neck. Once immobilized, the person can be carefully moved to safety. "
Emergencies and First Aid - Medical Identification Tags - Harvard Health,"A person with a serious medical condition such as diabetes, a drug allergy, or a heart condition should carry information about the condition on a necklace or bracelet, or on a card that can be carried in a pocket or wallet, so that proper care can be given in an emergency. Be sure to check for a medallion or card if you find yourself in the role of rescuer. If you or a member of your family has a life-threatening medical condition, obtain a medical identification tag or medallion from your local pharmacy and wear it at all times. "

Emergencies and First Aid - Removing a Speck From the Eye - Harvard Health,"Occasionally, an eyelash or speck of dirt gets into the eye and causes irritation. If tears that form do not wash out the object, it can sometimes be removed by pulling the upper eyelid down over the lower eyelid. The lashes of the lower eyelid may brush out any foreign object that is caught under the upper lid. If this does not work, try either of the procedures described below. Place a cotton-tipped swab behind the upper eyelid and carefully roll the eyelid back onto it. If you can see the object, remove it with the moistened end of another cotton swab or a facial tissue. Tilt the person's head to one side. Hold the eyelids open with two fingers and carefully use an eyedropper or a cup of water to flush water over the eye from the nose outward. If the object cannot be removed, cover the eye with a gauze bandage and seek medical attention.     "
Emergencies and First Aid - Butterfly Bandage - Harvard Health,
Emergencies and First Aid - Emergency Phone Numbers - Harvard Health,"Write down important telephone numbers and post them where you can refer to them easily, such as near your telephone or on your refrigerator. List the serious medical conditions (such as asthma or diabetes) of each family member on the back of the list. Teach your children how to call 911 and tell them to show the list to emergency medical personnel. The list should include the phone numbers of the police, the nearest fire department, ambulance services, a poison control center, and your doctors and the contact numbers for work, other locations, and a nearby relative or friend. You may also wish to include the phone numbers of the gas and electric companies, your childrens schools, the local pharmacy, or home health aides. "
Emergencies and First Aid - Childbirth - Harvard Health,"Birth of the Placenta If you are called on to help deliver a baby, remember that childbirth is a natural process and that your role is to assist the woman and offer encouragement. If a woman's contractions are very strong and 2 to 3 minutes apart or the water bag (amniotic sac) has broken, birth is very near. If the woman tells you that the birth will happen very soon, believe her. You will see quite a bit of blood, which is normal. You may see bloody fluid coming from the vagina before and during the birth; this is also normal. Immediate careCall 911 or have someone else call. Put down a large plastic sheet or plastic shower curtain and place sheets and towels or newspapers on top of the plastic to absorb fluids. Help the woman lie down with her legs apart and her back supported by a pillow. Wash your hands. Use disposable surgical gloves if you have them. During the birth, the woman may wish to lean forward and grab her knees, or she may want to squat or lie on her side. Let her decide which position is most comfortable. When the baby's head is visible in the vaginal opening, the birth is about to occur. Do not try to hurry the birth by pulling on the baby's head. Let the woman push the baby out. Usually, as the baby is born, the face will appear straight down or straight up. As soon as the head is outside the vagina, put two fingers along the top side of the head and feel around the neck area for a loop of the umbilical cord. It will be about the thickness of your little finger. If you can feel it, hook the loop of cord with your two fingers and slide it gently over the baby's head. The baby's head should then turn toward one side and the shoulders should come out. Assist the birth by supporting the baby's head and shoulders, but remember not to pull. Be careful the baby will be slippery. If there is a membrane covering the baby's mouth and nose, gently wipe it off with a clean cloth. Do not remove the whitish coating on the body. ITEMS TO GATHER: REMEMBER TO   AFTER DELIVERY  After delivery, hold the baby with his or her head slightly lower than the feet to drain fluid from the nose and throat. Do not hold the baby upside down or slap him or her. Gently dry off the baby and wrap him or her in a dry towel or blanket. The baby should start breathing and his or her color should improve as oxygen is breathed in. If the baby does not start breathing, place the baby on his or her back and gently rub the chest or tap the bottoms of the feet. If the baby still does not begin breathing, start mouth-to-mouth-and-nose resuscitation.    CUTTING THE UMBILICAL CORD The umbilical cord will pulsate during the birth and afterward, indicating that the baby is still receiving blood from the mother. Do not cut the cord until it stops pulsating. After it has stopped pulsating, tie off the cord tightly with heavy string, a clean shoelace, or sterile tape about 4 inches from the baby; tie it again 2 to 4 inches from the first string. Cut between the two ties. Wrap the baby in a soft blanket and place him or her on the mothers stomach. "
Emergencies and First Aid - Broken Bones - Harvard Health,"Broken bones (fractures) are usually not life-threatening. A fracture may not be visible to you through the skin. Symptoms include intense pain, swelling, increased pain when trying to move the injured area, or bleeding. A broken bone always requires medical attention. Immediate careCall out for someone to get help, or call 911 yourself. Do not move or straighten the broken bone. Splinting is not necessary unless the person needs to be moved without assistance from ambulance personnel or unless the fracture has blocked blood supply to the limb. If the fracture site is deformed and the skin beyond the site of the fracture is cold, pale, and blue, pull gently lengthwise on the limb to straighten the fracture and then splint the limb. How to Make a Sling "
Emergencies and First Aid - Removing a Fishhook - Harvard Health,"Never remove a fishhook that is embedded in the eye or face; seek medical attention immediately to have it removed. A fishhook embedded in skin should be removed by a doctor. If you are in a remote area and a doctor is not available, remove the fishhook following the directions in the illustration below. If the fishhook is embedded deeply in tissue, follow the instructions below for a multibarbed fishhook. A multibarbed fishhook should ideally be removed by a physician. If this is not possible, cut the eye off the shank of the hook, and then push the shank of the hook through the wound, following the path of the hook until the barbs exit and can be grasped with pliers. Flush the area well with running water, clean it with soap and water, and cover it with a bandage. Wrap the other end of the string several times around the index finger of your other hand (use your thumb to hold the loose end of the string tightly) (2). Move your index finger close to the hook to generate slack in the line. Pull on the string suddenly, with a jerk, in line with the hook. Flush the area with water, clean it with soap and water, and bandage it. "
Emergencies and First Aid - Birth of the Placenta - Harvard Health,"The placenta, which has provided the fetus with nourishment, is attached to the umbilical cord and is delivered about 20 minutes after the baby. Do not pull on the cord; delivery of the placenta occurs on its own. You can help by gently massaging the womans lower abdomen. The uterus will feel like a hard round mass. Massaging the abdomen helps the uterus contract, which also helps stop bleeding. After the placenta is delivered, place it in a plastic bag to take with the woman and baby to the hospital. It is normal for more bleeding to occur after delivery of the placenta. Continue gently massaging the womans lower abdomen. "
Emergencies and First Aid - How to Splint a Fracture - Harvard Health,"For a lower arm or wrist fracture (left), carefully place a folded newspaper, magazine, or heavy piece of clothing under the arm. Tie it in place with pieces of cloth. A lower leg or ankle fracture (right) can be splinted similarly, with a bulky garment or blanket wrapped and secured around the limb. A person with a hip or pelvis fracture should not be moved. If the person must be moved, the legs should be strapped together (with a towel or blanket in between them) and the person gently placed on a board, as for a back injury. "
